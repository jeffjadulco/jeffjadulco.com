I experienced this footer problem before in this site, but I got away with it because there are no pages that have no content to make this happen 😆. But in this [side project](https://hn.jeffjadulco.com) of mine (which is a Hacker News reader), there are times when a post don't have no comments yet, and I have no control over it.

I've looked for solutions over the internet and this is the most clever solution I saw: using `flexbox`.

```html showLineNumbers fileName=index.html
<html>
  <body>
    <header>Header</header>
    <main>Content</main>
    <footer>Footer</footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css showLineNumbers fileName=index.css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

main {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

I love this solution because it's so simple and it tells us what it does.

> 💡 The whole body is a flexbox which has a minimum height of whatever the browser's height is.
>
> 💡 The main content's height grows to occupy the remaining space. Pushing the footer to the bottom of the page.

<Image
  src={'/images/blog/footer-fixed.png'}
  alt="Fixed footer issue"
  width={1105}
  height={972}
  quality={100}
/>

And... that's it! Now the footer stays at the bottom whenever there are no or few contents in the page.

You can easily do it on Tailwind too!

```html showLineNumbers fileName=index.html
<div class="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
  <header>Header</header>
  <main class="flex-grow">Main Content</main>
  <footer>Footer</footer>
</div>
```

I've also made a simple example using CodeSandbox and Tailwind Play.
